ðŸ“Œ Project Overview


This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow (Keras) to classify images. The model extracts features from images, processes them through deep layers, and predicts their categories.


ðŸ“‚ Dataset


The dataset is loaded from a preprocessed .npy file (batch.npy).
Images are stored as NumPy arrays, and labels are stored in a dictionary.


ðŸš€ Installation & Setup


Prerequisites


Python 3.x
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib

ðŸ”¥ Improvements & Future Work


Implement Data Augmentation to improve generalization.
Add Early Stopping to prevent overfitting.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
Deploy the model using Flask/FastAPI for real-world applications.
